# LongLab_MMC
Repository for the code written for the MMC LongLab. The code performs the Metropis Monte Carlo algorithm to determine the atomic arrangement of a binary alloy with cubic system in 2D and 3D, as a function of temperature and interaction energy between the two atomic species. Higher temperatures and small bond energy differantials between identical and different atomic species lead to more randomized systems with higher entropy. Conversely, lower temperatures and strong bond energy differences lead to more ordered systems.
